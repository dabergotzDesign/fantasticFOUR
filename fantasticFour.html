          Richards recruited his old friend Ben Grimm, who had become a
          successful test pilot and astronaut, to pilot the starship. Richards
          was joined in California by Susan Storm. Richards and Storm were
          dating at the time.

          In the early years of the Fantastic Four, Sue spent much of her time
          keeping the team together. Reed spent long hours in his laboratory;
          Grimm moped over his appearance; Johnny acted out like any teenager.
          Her power of invisibility had little use in battling super-villains
          such as Doctor Doom and Galactus, but her empathy and common sense
          prevented several breakups and defections.

          Calling himself Human Torch in tribute to the World War II era hero of
          the same name, the youthful Johnny found new adventure as part of the
          Fantastic Four, proving to be an invaluable if somewhat volatile
          member of the team.

          The Fantastic Four were not just Ben's friends, they became his
          surrogate family, and he was like a beloved uncle to Reed and Sue's
          children, Franklin (whose middle name is Benjamin, after the Thing)
          and Valeria. He also often assisted his teammate Johnny during the
          young man's solo adventures.
